This project's goal is to organize the internal administration of the NGO and facilitate its interaction with collaborators.

Before this project all the profiles on NGO's donors were ineffectively stored in Word and Excel files, which complicated the resource management.

The anniversaries tab gives an overview of all the collaborators who have birthday in the current month.

The mobile app for saving, lending and borrowing between close friends and family.

Setting up a savings club isn’t easy. You need to track incoming cash, arrange payouts, and account for people who miss their payments.

The committee notebook is a must-have for any ROSCA organiser. This is where you’ll record who has paid in each month, and who has received their payout. 
If there are a lot of contributors in your club, and you’re dealing in cash, the notebook will help you keep track of all your ROSCA contributions.

It takes a lot of work to set up and maintain your ROSCA, so anything that makes the job easier is welcome.
